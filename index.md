### Welcome
Trick Track Truck project page

It's a toy project to play with lot of technologies: Docker, CouchDB, Angular2, ... Another goal is to develop components such as in a real project with requirements, build and deployment procedure.

The main repository maintains this site which provides:
* blog posts about issue development and feedback
* requirements
* UAT materials

All components will be developed under their own repository and may be developped many times to test different technologies (language, framework, etc.).

### Naming
The true name would be Truck Track Trick for good english name but:
* I find it hard to pronounce
* Choosen name is a wordplay with [Tric Trac](https://www.trictrac.net/) (a famous french site about board games)

Word by word:
* *Trick* relates to things that help (ie. a tool)
* *Track* relates to delivery
* *Truck* ...
